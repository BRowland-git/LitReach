We aimed to identify the available data sources to calculate the BoD of (P)VPD in participating VITAL countries and to pinpoint data gaps. Based on epidemiological criteria and vaccine availability, we prioritized (P) VPD caused by Extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), norovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Staphylococcus aureus, and pneumococcal pneumonia.MethodsWe conducted a survey on available data (e.g. incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), sequelae, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), etc.) among national experts from European countries, and carried out five pathogen-specific literature reviews by searching MEDLINE for peer-reviewed publications published between 2009 and 2019.ResultsMorbidity and mortality data were generally available for all five diseases, while summary BoD estimates were mostly lacking. Available data were not always stratified by age and risk group, which is especially important when calculating BoD for ageing adults. AMR data were available in several countries for S. aureus and ExPEC.ConclusionThis study provides an exhaustive overview of the available data sources and data gaps for the estimation of BoD of five (P) VPD in ageing adults in the EU/EAA, which is useful to guide pathogen-specific BoD studies and contribute to calculation of (P)VPDs BoD.","[Meroc, Estelle; Bollaerts, Kaatje] P95 Epidemiol & Pharmacovigilance, Koning Leopold III Laan 1, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Froberg, Janeri] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Radboud Inst Mol Life Sci, Sect Paediat Infect Dis, Geert Grootepl 21, NL-6525 EZ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Almasi, Timea] Syreon Res Inst, Mexikoi Str 65-A, H-1142 Budapest, Hungary; [Winje, Brita Askeland; Steens, Anneke] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Control & Vaccine, POB 222, N-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Orrico-Sanchez, Alejandro] FISABIO Valencia Fdn Promot Hlth & Biomed Res, Vaccines Res Unit, Ave Catalunya,21, Valencia 46020, Spain; [McDonald, Scott A.; Knol, Mirjam J.] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Ctr Infect Dis Control, POB 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Méroc, E (corresponding author), P95 Epidemiol & Pharmacovigilance, Koning Leopold III Laan 1, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",estelle.meroc@p-95.com,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,APR 13,2021,21,1,,,,,,,345,10.1186/s12879-021-06017-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06017-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000640390800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Aims: We tested if anticipated treatment-seeking decisions for suspected infectious intestinal disease could be related to emotional response, tolerance of symptoms, or beliefs about the consequential benefits and harms of seeking treatment (or not). Methods: Questionnaire survey of adults living in the UK with statistical analysis of responses. A vignette was presented about a hypothetical gastrointestinal illness. People stated their emotional reactions, expected actions in response and beliefs about possible benefits or harms from seeking treatment (or not getting treatment). Multinomial regression looked for predictors of anticipated behaviour. Results: People were inclined to consult a GP when they believed that seeking treatment would be beneficial and that its absence would be harmful. Seeking treatment was less anticipated if the condition was expected to improve quickly. Respondents were also more likely to consult if they strongly disliked fever or headache, and/or if the illness made them feel anxious or angry. Treatment-seeking (or lack of it) was not linked to harms from treatment-seeking, other specific symptoms and emotional responses. Conclusion: It was possible to link anticipated treatment-seeking behaviour to specific factors: expected prognosis, perceived benefits of seeking treatment, some emotions and some specific symptoms.

Published estimates on the prevalence of infectious intestinal diseases (IID) in the UAE are scarce and exclusively based on hospital data. The aim of this study was to provide the first prevalence estimates of IID in the UAE. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study design using a telephone-based questionnaire was used to estimate the IID prevalence in the previous 4 weeks in a representative sample of the Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) population from January to September 2017. Results: Data were collected from 1254 participants (57.3% male; 25.2% <18 years). The prevalence of IID was 4.2% in the 4 weeks prior to the interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that being female (odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-5.1) and having a middle-range monthly household income (approx.

Age >= 6 years was negatively associated with IID (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99). Forty-nine percent of participants with an IID sought medical care and 20.8% took over-the-counter medication. Conclusions: This study provides the first population-based prevalence estimates of IID in the UAE, which are similar to those reported in China (4%), but lower than those reported in Canada (10%), the Netherlands (7%), and the USA (6%).

But integrating these techniques into public health practice remains an ongoing challenge, and requires close collaboration between modellers, epidemiologists, and public health staff. During the 2016 and 2017 Australian influenza seasons, weekly seasonal influenza forecasts were produced for cities in the three states with the largest populations: Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Forecast results were presented to Health Department disease surveillance units in these jurisdictions, who provided feedback about the plausibility and public health utility of these predictions. In earlier studies we found that delays in reporting and processing of surveillance data substantially limited forecast performance, and that incorporating climatic effects on transmission improved forecast performance. In this study of the 2016 and 2017 seasons, we sought to refine the forecasting method to account for delays in receiving the data, and used meteorological data from past years to modulate the force of infection. We demonstrate how these refinements improved the forecast's predictive capacity, and use the 2017 influenza season to highlight challenges in accounting for population and clinician behaviour changes in response to a severe season.","[Moss, Robert; McCaw, James M.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Modelling & Simulat Unit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zarebski, Alexander E.; McCaw, James M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dawson, Peter] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Franklin, Lucinda J.] Victorian Govt Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Regulat Hlth Protect & Emergency Management Div, Hlth Protect Branch, Communicable Dis Sect, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Birrell, Frances A.] Dept Hlth, Prevent Div, Communicable Dis Branch, Epidemiol & Res Unit, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [McCaw, James M.] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Defence Science & Technology; Queensland Health; Murdoch Children's Research Institute,"Moss, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Modelling & Simulat Unit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 15,2019,43,,,,,,,,,10.33321/cdi.2019.43.7,http://dx.doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2019.43.7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000461515900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the UK community incidence of norovirus has been estimated at 59/1000 population, equating to four million cases a year. Whilst norovirus infects people of all ages, a substantial burden occurs in infants and young children. The population of viruses found in sporadic cases among infants has been observed to be more diverse than that associated with outbreaks. In this study, we analysed norovirus-positive specimens collected during the second study of infectious intestinal diseases (IID2 Study) a national community cohort study conducted between April 2008 and August 2009 We examined the data for differences in circulating norovirus strains between two arms of a community cohort, and differences between genotypes and disease outcomes such as illness duration and symptom profiles.MethodsAnalysis was conducted to assess genetic diversity of noroviruses in the community. We also assessed differences in the cycle threshold (Ct) value, as a proxy for viral load, between norovirus genogroups and genotypes, and differences in reported symptoms or length of illness in relation to genogroup and genotype.ResultsThere were 477 samples where norovirus was detected. Whilst 85% of people recovered within two days for vomiting; diarrhoea symptoms were reported to day 4 for 83% of the cases, and 10% of people reported symptoms of diarrhoea lasting between five and six days. Both diarrhoea and vomiting symptoms lasted longer in children aged <5years compared to adults. There was a significantly higher proportion of GII.4 in samples obtained from the GP arm of the study (chi-square=17.8, p<0.001) compared to samples received via post in the self-reporting arm. In the latter group, the prevalence of GII.6 was significantly higher (chi-square=7.5, p<0.001).ConclusionsWe found that there is a difference in disease severity by age group. Children aged <5years had longer duration of illness, with 10% still having diarrhoea at seven days, and vomiting of between four and five days. The duration of illness reported is higher overall than one might expect for cases in the community in otherwise healthy individuals which has implications for infection control. No differences were observed in relation to duration of vomiting and or diarrhoea by genotype.","[Harris, John P.; O'Brien, Sarah J.] Univ Liverpool, Instutue Populat Hlth Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Iturriza-Gomara, Miren; Kelly, Susan] Univ Liverpool, Inst Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Allen, David J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Harris, John P.; Iturriza-Gomara, Miren; Allen, David J.; O'Brien, Sarah J.] NIHR HPRU Gastrointestinal Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [O'Brien, Sarah J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Modelling Evidence & Policy Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Newcastle University - UK,"Harris, JP (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Instutue Populat Hlth Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Harris, JP (corresponding author), NIHR HPRU Gastrointestinal Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",john.harris@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 25,2019,19,,,,,,,,87,10.1186/s12879-019-3706-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3706-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000456703200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A sample of these eligible patients were selected to participate in two phone-based surveys and to self-collect a stool sample for laboratory testing. To ascertain household transmission patterns, information on household members with acute gastroenteritis was gathered from participants, and symptomatic household members were contacted to participate in a survey and provide stool sample as well. Results 54% of individuals who met enrollment criteria agreed to participate, and 76% of those individuals returned a stool sample. Among household members, 85% of eligible individuals agreed to participate, and 68% of those returned a stool sample.

To further understanding of the epidemiology and control of norovirus, there has been much recent interest in describing the transmission dynamics of norovirus through mathematical models. In this study, we review the current modelling approaches for norovirus transmission. We examine the data and methods used to estimate these models that vary structurally and parametrically between different epidemiological contexts. Many of the existing studies at population level have focused on the same case notification dataset, whereas models from outbreak settings are highly specific and difficult to generalise. In this review, we explore the consistency in the description of norovirus transmission dynamics and the robustness of parameter estimates between studies. In particular, we find that there is considerable variability in estimates of key parameters such as the basic reproduction number, which may mean that the effort required to control norovirus at the population level may currently be underestimated.","[Gaythorpe, K.

In 2014, notification rates for Switzerland were 92.9 per 100 000 population for campylobacteriosis and 15.2 per 100 000 population for salmonellosis. These notification rates originate from laboratory-based surveillance whereby positive test results are reported to the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases. Consequently, notification rates do not directly correspond to the disease burden among the population as the number of positive tests depends on patients' healthcare-seeking behaviour, stool sampling rates and other factors. METHODS: We assessed laboratory positivity rates (proportion of positive tests among all tests performed) of diagnostic tests for Campylobacter and Salmonella from five private laboratories in Switzerland between 2003 and 2012. We analysed demographic characteristics, temporal and spatial distribution of test numbers and positivity rates. Predictors for a positive test and disease seasonality were assessed with logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 135 122 (13 095 positive) Campylobacter tests and 136 997 (2832 positive) Salmonella tests were obtained with positive tests corresponding to 20.4% and 17.2% of notified campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cases, respectively. The number of tests conducted annually increased for both pathogens by 51% from 2003 to 2012. Annual positivity rates of Campylobacter increased from 7.6 to 11.1% and rates of Salmonella decreased from 2.7 to 1.5%. The largest increases in annual Campylobacter positivity rates were observed for patients older than 85 years (+ 193.7%), followed by children aged 5-9 years (+ 131.9%). Positivity rates and test numbers for both diseases by month or calendar week showed a distinct seasonality, with peak rates for Salmonella occurring in autumn and for Campylobacter in summer and at the turn of the year. These findings were independent of patients' age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Both positivity rates and notification rates showed increasing trends for Campylobacter and decreasing trends for Salmonella, suggesting that these trends reflect changes in disease epidemiology at population level. The continuous assessment of positivity rates remains important to appropriately interpret changes observed in the notification system especially considering the increasing use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction test panels where multiple pathogens are tested simultaneously.","[Justus, Bless Philipp; Claudia, Schmutz; Kathrin, Sartori; Daniel, Maeusezahl] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Justus, Bless Philipp; Claudia, Schmutz; Kathrin, Sartori; Daniel, Maeusezahl] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute; University of Basel,"Daniel, M (corresponding author), Socinstr 57, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",daniel.maeusezahl@swis-stph.ch,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 18,2017,147,,,,,,,,w14569,10.4414/smw.2017.14569,http://dx.doi.org/10.4414/smw.2017.14569,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000422954400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Negative consequences including sickness absence are common, but little is known about the social patterning of these outcomes, or the extent to which they relate to disease severity. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using IID cases identified from a large population-based survey, to explore the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and symptom severity and sickness absence; and to assess the role of symptom severity on the relationship between SES and absence. Regression modelling was used to investigate these associations, whilst controlling for potential confounders such as age, sex and ethnicity. Results: Among 1164 cases, those of lower SES versus high had twice the odds of experiencing severe symptoms (OR 2.2, 95% CI;1.66-2.87). Lower SES was associated with higher odds of sickness absence (OR 1.8, 95% CI;1.26-2.69), however this association was attenuated after adjusting for symptom severity (OR 1.4, 95% CI; 0.92-2.07). Conclusions: In a large sample of IID cases, those of low SES versus high were more likely to report severe symptoms, and sickness absence; with greater severity largely explaining the higher absence.

Here we extend these methods to clinical observation and laboratory-confirmation data for Melbourne, on the grounds that these data sources provide more accurate characterizations of influenza activity. We show that from each of these data sources we can accurately predict the timing of the epidemic peak 4-6 weeks in advance. We also show that making simultaneous use of multiple surveillance systems to improve forecast skill remains a fundamental challenge. Disparate systems provide complementary characterizations of disease activity, which may or may not be comparable, and it is unclear how a ground truth' for evaluating forecasts against these multiple characterizations might be defined. These findings are a significant step towards making optimal use of routine surveillance data for outbreak forecasting.","[Moss, R.; McCaw, J.

Clinical laboratories are now using WGS for pathogen identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and epidemiological typing. WGS data also represent a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of molecular diagnostic assays, which continue to play an important role in clinical microbiology. To demonstrate this application of WGS, this study used publicly available genomic data to evaluate a duplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay that targets mapA and ceuE for the detection of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, leading global causes of bacterial gastroenteritis. In silico analyses of mapA and ceuE primer and probe sequences from 1,713 genetically diverse C. jejuni and C. coli genomes, supported by RT-PCR testing, indicated that the assay was robust, with 1,707 (99.7%) isolates correctly identified. The high specificity of the mapA-ceuE assay was the result of interspecies diversity and intraspecies conservation of the target genes in C. jejuni and C. coli. Rare instances of a lack of specificity among C. coli isolates were due to introgression in mapA or sequence diversity in ceuE. The results of this study illustrate how WGS can be exploited to evaluate molecular diagnostic assays by using publicly available data, online databases, and open-source software.","[van Rensburg, Melissa J.

Although they are a highly diverse group of viruses, genogroup-II genotype-4 (GII-4) noroviruses are the most frequently identified strains worldwide. The predominance of GII-4 norovirus strains is driven by the periodic emergence of antigenic variants capable of evading herd protection. The global molecular epidemiology of emerging GII-4 strains is largely based on data from outbreak surveillance programmes, but the epidemiology of GII-4 strains among sporadic or community cases is far less well studied. To understand the distribution of GII-4 norovirus strains associated with gastroenteritis in the wider population, we characterised the GII-4 norovirus strains detected during studies of sporadic cases of infectious gastroenteritis collected in the UK and Malawi between 1993 and 2009. Our data shows that GII-4 norovirus strains that have emerged as strains of global epidemic importance have circulated in the community up to 18 years before their recognition as pandemic strains associated with increases in outbreaks. These data may suggest that more comprehensive surveillance programmes that incorporate strains associated with sporadic cases may provide a way for early detection of emerging strains with pandemic potential. This may be of particular relevance as vaccines become available.","[Allen, David J.; Callaghan, Anna] Publ Hlth England, Virus Reference Dept, London, England; [Trainor, Eamonn; Cunliffe, Nigel A.; Iturriza-Gomara, Miren] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Clin Infect Microbiol & Immunol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Callaghan, Anna] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Pathogen Mol Biol Unit, London WC1, England; [O'Brien, Sarah J.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Allen, David J.; O'Brien, Sarah J.; Iturriza-Gomara, Miren] Univ Liverpool, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit Gastrointestinal Infec, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Trainor, Eamonn] St Helens & Knowsley Teaching Hosp NHS Trust, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Public Health England; University of Liverpool; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Iturriza-Gomara, M (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Clin Infect Microbiol & Immunol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.;Iturriza-Gomara, M (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit Gastrointestinal Infec, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",M.Iturriza-Gomara@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,,21,27,,,,,,,,,,,APR 26,2016,11,4,,,,,,,e0146972,10.1371/journal.pone.0146972,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146972,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000374973600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/Setting A retrospective telephone survey undertaken in each of the four countries comprising the United Kingdom. Participants were randomly asked about illness either in the past 7 or 28 days. Participants 14,813 individuals for all of whom we had a legible recording of their agreement to participate Outcomes Self-reported IID, defined as loose stools or clinically significant vomiting lasting less than two weeks, in the absence of a known non-infectious cause. Results The rate of self-reported IID varied substantially depending on whether asked for illness in the previous 7 or 28 days. After standardising for age and sex, and adjusting for the number of interviews completed each month and the relative size of each UK country, the estimated rate of IID in the 7-day recall group was 1,530 cases per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 1135-2113), while in the 28-day recall group it was 533 cases per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 377-778). There was no significant variation in rates between the four countries. Rates in this study were also higher than in a related prospective study undertaken at the same time. Conclusions The estimated burden of disease from IID varied dramatically depending on study design. Retrospective studies of IID give higher estimates of disease burden than prospective studies. Of retrospective studies longer recall periods give lower estimated rates than studies with short recall periods. Caution needs to be exercised when comparing studies of self-reported IID as small changes in study design or case definition can markedly affect estimated rates.","[Viviani, Laura; Tam, Clarence C.; Rodrigues, Laura C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London WC1, England; [van der Es, Mike; Irvine, Lisa; Hunter, Paul R.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Sch Med, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Jackson, Kathryn A.; O'Brien, Sarah J.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of East Anglia; University of Liverpool,"Hunter, PR (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Norwich Sch Med, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Paul.Hunter@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,,9,12,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 25,2016,11,1,,,,,,,e0146171,10.1371/journal.pone.0146171,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146171,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000369527800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The oral infant rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix, was introduced in England and Wales in July 2013. We estimated the impact on laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections and hospitalizations for all-cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE) during the first year after introduction. Methods. We extracted data on laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections (July 2000 through June 2015) and all-cause AGE-associated hospitalizations (July 2007 through June 2014) for all age groups using national databases (LabBase2 and HES). We determined the ratio of the rate during the 2013-2014 rotavirus season to the rate during the prevaccination era. Results. In infants, there was a 77% decline (rate ratio [RR], 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], .16-.32) in laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections and a 26% decline (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, .65-.84) in all-cause AGE-associated hospitalizations in 2013-2014, compared with the prevaccination era. Large reductions were also observed in older children, adults, and older adults. We estimated that 10 884 laboratory-confirmed infections and 50 427 all-cause AGE-associated hospital admissions were averted in 2013-2014. Similar reductions have been observed for laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections during the 2014-2015 season. Conclusions.

Design: A modelling study combining data from national public health surveillance systems for laboratory-confirmed infectious intestinal disease (IID) and outbreaks of foodborne disease and 2 prospective, population-based studies of IID in the community. The underlying data sets covered the time period 1993-008. We used Monte Carlo simulation and a Bayesian approach, using a systematic review to generate Bayesian priors. We calculated point estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Setting: UK, 2009. Outcome measures: Pathogen-specific estimates of the number of cases, general practice (GP) consultations and hospitalisations for foodborne disease in the UK in 2009. Results: Bayesian approaches gave slightly more conservative estimates of overall health burden (similar to 511 000 cases vs 566 000 cases). Campylobacter is the most common foodborne pathogen, causing 280 400 (95% CrI 182 503-435 693) food-related cases and 38 860 (95% CrI 27 160-55 610) GP consultations annually. Despite this, there are only around 562 (95% CrI 189-1330) food-related hospital admissions due to Campylobacter, reflecting relatively low disease severity. Salmonella causes the largest number of hospitalisations, an estimated 2490 admissions (95% CrI 607-9631), closely followed by Escherichia coli O157 with 2233 admissions (95% CrI 170-32 159). Other common causes of foodborne disease include Clostridium perfringens, with an estimated 79 570 cases annually (95% CrI 30 700-211 298) and norovirus with 74 100 cases (95% CrI 61 150-89 660). Other viruses and protozoa ranked much lower as causes of foodborne disease. Conclusions: The 3 models yielded similar estimates of the burden of foodborne illness in the UK and show that continued reductions in Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli O157, C. perfringens and norovirus are needed to mitigate the impact of foodborne disease.","[O'Brien, Sarah J.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [O'Brien, Sarah J.] Univ Liverpool, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit Gastrointestinal Infec, Farr Inst HeRC, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Larose, Tricia L.; Tam, Clarence C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Larose, Tricia L.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Gen Practice, Trondheim, Norway; [Adak, Goutam K.] Publ Hlth England Ctr Infect Dis Surveillance & C, Dept Gastrointestinal Emerging & Zoonot Infect, London, England; [Evans, Meirion R.] Cardiff Univ, Inst Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Cardiff, Wales; [Tam, Clarence C.] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Public Health England; Cardiff University; National University of Singapore,"O'Brien, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;O'Brien, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit Gastrointestinal Infec, Farr Inst HeRC, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",s.j.obrien@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,,23,23,,,,,,,,,,,,2016,6,9,,,,,,,e011119,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011119,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000391302900144,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies in Sweden have primarily focused on incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness related to consumption of contaminated food and drinking water. Methods: In May 2009, we sent a questionnaire to 4000 randomly selected persons aged 0-85 years, asking about the number of episodes of stomach disease during the last 12 months. To validate the data on symptoms, we compared the study results with anonymous queries submitted to a Swedish medical website. Results: The response rate was 64%. We estimated that a total number of 2744,778 acute gastrointestinal illness episodes (95% confidence intervals 2475,641-3013,915) occurred between 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2009. Comparing the number of reported episodes with web queries indicated that the low number of episodes during the first 6 months was an effect of seasonality rather than recall bias. Further, the result of the recall bias analysis suggested that the survey captured approximately 65% of the true number of episodes among the respondents. Conclusions: The estimated number of Swedish acute gastrointestinal illness cases in this study is about five times higher than previous estimates. This study provides valuable information on the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in Sweden, irrespective of route of transmission, indicating a high burden of acute gastrointestinal illness, especially among children, and large societal costs, primarily due to production losses.","[Hansdotter, Frida I.] Publ Hlth Agcy Sweden, Dept Knowledge Dev, SE-17182 Solna, Sweden; [Magnusson, Mans] Linkoping Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Kuhlmann-Berenzon, Sharon; Hulth, Anette] Publ Hlth Agcy Sweden, Dept Monitoring & Evaluat, SE-17182 Solna, Sweden; [Sundstrom, Kristian] Lund Univ, Inst Food & Agr Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hedlund, Kjell-Olof; Andersson, Yvonne] Swedish Inst Communicable Dis Control, Linkoping, Sweden",Public Health Agency of Sweden; Linkoping University; Public Health Agency of Sweden; Lund University; Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control,"Hulth, A (corresponding author), Publ Hlth Agcy Sweden, SE-17182 Solna, Sweden.",anette.hulth@folkhalsomyndigheten.se,,,,,,,,17,20,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2015,43,5,,,,,540,547,,10.1177/1403494815576787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1403494815576787,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000357581300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

This difference was not observed in animals<1 year old. Younger animals in both species had higher PMDs than adult animals (P<0.001). Neutering was associated with reduced PMD in young male dogs. In adult dogs, miniature Schnauzers had the highest PMD. Most animals with diarrhoea (51%) presented having been ill for 2-4 days, but a history of vomiting or haemorrhagic diarrhoea was associated with a shorter time to presentation.

The symptoms of AGI are usually not severe enough for consultation with a physician. The more exact data on the burden of AGI are gained through cross sectional population-based studies. To estimate the burden of AGI in Slovenia, a period prevalence study was conducted. Methods: A simple random sample consisting of 5000 Slovenian inhabitants was chosen to whom a questionnaire was sent in July 2011. The participants were asked if they experienced AGI in June 2011 according to a symptom-based case definition. The participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire on a paper or via a web page created for study purposes. Results: Out of 5000 participants, 1500 filled out the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 33%. The number of women responding out-numbered men - there were 58% female and 42% male responders. 66 (4.4%) of the responders claimed to have had AGI in June 2011. The incidence rate of acute AGI was therefore 4400 per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparatively, the incidence rate of notified cases in the same month was 78.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. The difference between the incidence of AGI, based on notified cases and incidence, calculated in the first Slovenian cross sectional study, showed that one out of 56 cases of AGI in the community has been notified. Conclusion: the incidence of AGI among the Slovenian population, based on data from our cross sectional study, is as expected higher than the incidence calculated from notification data from the same period.","[Grilc, Eva; Socan, Maja] Inst Publ Hlth Republ Slovenia, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",,"Grilc, E (corresponding author), Inst Publ Hlth Republ Slovenia, Trubarjeva 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",eva.grilc@ivz-rs.si,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2014,53,2,,,,,125,132,,10.2478/sjph-2014-0013,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sjph-2014-0013,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000334849700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

E.",,Burden Communicable Dis Europe BCo,Measuring underreporting and under-ascertainment in infectious disease datasets: a comparison of methods,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Efficient and reliable surveillance and notification systems are vital for monitoring public health and disease outbreaks. However, most surveillance and notification systems are affected by a degree of underestimation (UE) and therefore uncertainty surrounds the 'true' incidence of disease affecting morbidity and mortality rates. Surveillance systems fail to capture cases at two distinct levels of the surveillance pyramid: from the community since not all cases seek healthcare (under-ascertainment), and at the healthcare-level, representing a failure to adequately report symptomatic cases that have sought medical advice (underreporting). There are several methods to estimate the extent of under-ascertainment and underreporting. Methods: Within the context of the ECDC-funded Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE)-project, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify studies that estimate ascertainment or reporting rates for salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis in European Union Member States (MS) plus European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries Iceland, Norway and Switzerland and four other OECD countries (USA, Canada, Australia and Japan). Multiplication factors (MFs), a measure of the magnitude of underestimation, were taken directly from the literature or derived (where the proportion of underestimated, under-ascertained, or underreported cases was known) and compared for the two pathogens. Results: MFs varied between and within diseases and countries, representing a need to carefully select the most appropriate MFs and methods for calculating them. The most appropriate MFs are often disease-,country-, age-, and sex-specific. Conclusions: When routine data are used to make decisions on resource allocation or to estimate epidemiological parameters in populations, it becomes important to understand when, where and to what extent these data represent the true picture of disease, and in some instances (such as priority setting) it is necessary to adjust for underestimation. MFs can be used to adjust notification and surveillance data to provide more realistic estimates of incidence.","[Gibbons, Cheryl L.; Peterson, Karen L.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mangen, Marie-Josee J.; Brooke, Russell John; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E.

To ensure this method was universally suitable, panels of samples known to contain target bacteria, viruses or parasites were processed in triplicate using the pre-treatment method routinely used for each target and the new extraction method (bead beating). The extracts were tested using real-time PCR and the cycle threshold values were compared. The results from this study showed that bead beating improved yields for the bacterial and parasitic targets and was suitable for the viral targets.

This study used bacterial load, the presence of co-infections and demographic data to assess if EAEC was independently associated with intestinal infectious disease. Quantitative real-time PCR data (Ct values) generated directly from stool specimens for several pathogen targets were analysed to identify multiple pathogens, including EAEC, in the stools of cases and healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity using Ct value (60% and 60%) was not useful for identifying cases or controls, but an independent association between disease and EAEC presence was demonstrated: multivariate logistic regression for EAEC presence (odds ratio: 2.41; 95% confidence interval: 1.78-3.26; p<0.001). The population-attributable fraction was 3.3%. The group of bacteria known as EAEC are associated with gastrointestinal disease in at least half of the cases with EAEC positive stools.

Methodology and Principal Findings: A prospective cohort study of 611 individuals receiving small supplies in England was conducted. Water supplies received sanitary inspection and examination for indicator bacteria and participants maintained a daily record of IID. Regression modeling with generalized estimating equations that included interaction terms between age and indicators of fecal pollution was performed. Crude IID prevalence was 9.3 days with symptoms/1000 person days (95% CI: 8.4, 10.1) and incidence was 3.2 episodes/1000 person days (95% CI, 2.7, 3.7) or 1.2 episodes per person year. Although there was no overall association between IID risk and indicator presence, there was strong interaction between age and indicator presence. In children under ten, relative risk (RR) of IID in those drinking from enterococci contaminated supplies was 4.8 (95% CI: 1.5, 15.3) for incidence and 8.9 (95% CI: 2.8, 27.5) for prevalence. In those aged 10 to 59, IID risk was lower but not statistically significant. Conclusions: Contaminated small water supplies pose a substantial risk of IID to young children who live in homes reliant on these supplies.

Large-scale, prospective studies of infectious intestinal disease (IID) in developed countries are uncommon. Two studies of IID incidence and etiology have been conducted in the United Kingdom: the Infectious Intestinal Disease Study in England (IID1) in 1993-1996 and the Second Study of Infectious Intestinal Disease in the Community (IID2) in 2008-2009. We examined changes in etiology and diagnostic yield of IID cases over 15 years. Methods. Fecal samples submitted by IID cases were examined for a range of bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens using traditional and molecular microbiological methods. We calculated the percentage of specimens positive for each organism based on traditional methods and on traditional and molecular methods combined. We compared the distributions of organisms in the 2 studies. Results. For pathogens investigated in both studies, 40% of fecal samples submitted by cases in IID2 were positive compared with 28% in IID1. Viruses were most frequent among community cases in IID2. Campylobacter was the most common bacterial pathogen among cases presenting to healthcare. Major differences between the 2 studies were increases in the detection of norovirus and sapovirus and a decline Salmonella. Conclusions. Most fecal specimens were negative for the pathogens tested in both studies, so new strategies are needed to close the diagnostic gap. Among known pathogens, effective control of norovirus, rotavirus, and Campylobacter remain high priorities. The reduction in nontyphoidal salmonellosis demonstrates the success of Europe-wide control strategies, notably an industry-led Salmonella control program in poultry in the United Kingdom.","[Tam, Clarence C.; Rodrigues, Laura C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [O'Brien, Sarah J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Translat Med, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [O'Brien, Sarah J.] Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Tompkins, David S.] Hlth Protect Agcy, Reg Lab, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bolton, Frederick J.; Mather, Katherine; Ridge, Alan; Wood, Bernard] Hlth Protect Agcy, Reg Lab, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Berry, Lisa; Choudhury, Dalia; Halstead, Fenella; Iturriza-Gomara, Miren; Wain, John; Gray, James J.] Hlth Protect Agcy, Ctr Infect, London, England; [Rait, Greta] UCL, Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gray, James J.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Med Hlth Policy & Practice, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Health Protection Agency; Health Protection Agency; Health Protection Agency; University of London; University College London; University of East Anglia,"O'Brien, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Leahurst Campus,Chester High Rd, Neston CH64 7TE, England.",s.j.obrien@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,,118,127,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2012,54,9,,,,,1275,1286,,10.1093/cid/cis028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis028,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000302805700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using the Danish population register, a random population sample stratified by gender and age groups was selected and mobile or landline phone numbers found. Representative numbers of interviews were performed by gender, age group and month. A recently proposed international case definition of AGI, including cases with diarrhoea and/or vomiting in a 4-week recall period, was used. A total of 1853 individuals were included and 206 (11.1%) fulfilled the case definition; 78% reported diarrhoea. This corresponds to an overall standardized incidence rate of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6) episodes of AGI per person-year. The incidence rate was generally higher in the younger age groups; only being 2.3, 1.9 and 0.80 per person-year in the 0-9, 10-39 and >= 40 years age groups, respectively. The incidence rate estimates were considerably higher when calculated from shorter recall periods.","[Muller, L.; Ethelberg, S.] Statens Serum Inst, Dept Epidemiol, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark; [Korsgaard, H.] Tech Univ, Natl Food Inst, Div Microbiol & Risk Assessment, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ethelberg, S.] Statens Serum Inst, Dept Microbiol Surveillance & Res, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark",Statens Serum Institut; Technical University of Denmark; Statens Serum Institut,"Ethelberg, S (corresponding author), Statens Serum Inst, Dept Epidemiol, Artillerivej 5, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.",set@ssi.dk,,,,,,,,43,51,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,140,2,,,,,290,298,,10.1017/S0950268811000471,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268811000471,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000299655200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design Prospective, community cohort study and prospective study of GP presentation conducted between April 2008 and August 2009. Setting Eighty-eight GPs across the UK recruited from the Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework and the Primary Care Research Networks. Participants 6836 participants registered with the 88 participating practices in the community study; 991 patients with UK-acquired IID presenting to one of 37 practices taking part in the GP presentation study. Main outcome measures IID rates in the community, presenting to GP and reported to national surveillance, overall and by organism; annual IID cases and GP consultations by organism. Results The overall rate of IID in the community was 274 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 254 to 296); the rate of GP consultations was 17.7 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 14.4 to 21.8). There were 147 community cases and 10 GP consultations for every case reported to national surveillance. Norovirus was the most common organism, with incidence rates of 47 community cases per 1000 person-years and 2.1 GP consultations per 1000 person-years. Campylobacter was the most common bacterial pathogen, with a rate of 9.3 cases per 1000 person-years in the community, and 1.3 GP consultations per 1000 person-years. We estimate that there are up to 17 million sporadic, community cases of IID and 1 million GP consultations annually in the UK. Of these, norovirus accounts for 3 million cases and 130 000 GP consultations, and Campylobacter is responsible for 500 000 cases and 80 000 GP consultations. Conclusions IID poses a substantial community and healthcare burden in the UK. Control efforts must focus particularly on reducing the burden due to Campylobacter and enteric viruses.","[Tam, Clarence C.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Tam, CC (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",clarence.tam@lshtm.ac.uk,,,,,,,,410,435,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2012,61,1,,,,,69,77,,10.1136/gut.2011.238386,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gut.2011.238386,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-11-27,WOS:000298179200011,View Full Record in Web of Science
